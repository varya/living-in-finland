## Children

### How about maternity leave?

Maternity leave starts 5 weeks before the child's estimated date of delivery. Since then 105 days of maternity allowance starts. For these period mother gets about 70% of her usual salary (or minimum â‚¬24,02 for every working day).

If 2nd baby comes within 3 year, and teh mother could not reach income bigger than before delivering her 1st child, the payments for the 2nd child stay the same as for the 1st.

After maternity leave ends, a mother may proceed to parental leave, which is another 158 days. However unlike mathernity leave which is only applicable for mothers, parental leave can be granted to father as well.
